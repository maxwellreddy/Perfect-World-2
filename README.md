# Perfect-World-2

This is a short 2D shooter game that I developed using Godot Engine. Unfortunately, the package and executable files were too large to upload onto here. So, I provided a download link to the game instead:

This zip file contains the executable file, the package, and a file listing the controls. 

One of the music files used for this game was not included in this repository because the file was too large. So, there might be no music playing or the game will not run at all if you try downloading the uncompiled version of the game here.
